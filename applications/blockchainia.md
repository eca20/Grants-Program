## Project Overview

### Overview

 Blockchainia delivers the benefits of digital ownership straight to gamers fingertips. Our infrastructure will enable developers to create games for gamers that decide to take ownership of their digital achievements. The Blockchainia library of pallets enables affordable pay-to-play games that forever immortalize gamings greatest moments on-chain. As an eventual competive gaming metaverse, Blockchaina's ecosystem includes a community hosted online multiplayer infrastructure consisting of game servers that will interact directly with our parachain for user moderated online gaming.

Our Milestone 1 open-source pallets will enable:
- a browser based PvPvE first-person shooter (Player vs Player vs Environment (AI) Enemy
)
- a leader board that aggregates in-game earned on-chain statistics by week, month, and year.
 - air dropped NFTs earned by completing in game tasks and leader board achievements
 - environment enemies spawned from on-chain NFT assets that funnel spoils back to its owner's wallet
  - a player prompt to create a wallet upon exit or completion
  - community driven DAO that manages the online server infrastructure

Future milestones will include updates to:
- an evolving and expanding list of features through our open-source substrate pallet library
- Two games that use our pallets to share in game items between them
    - an evolving JRPG that explains our parachains "lore"
    - an evolving arcade style online multiplayer PvPvE

While there are other gaming projects in the ecosystem, ours differs in various ways. First, we will break the stigma gamers associate with NFTs through a fun JRPG. Non-playable character "blocks" will explain their purpose as well as the metaverse they inhabit in their on-chain existence. However, not all is as it seems in the troubled world of Blockchainia. Players will make their way through seasonally released updates to uncover the deep lore, rescue these NPC blocks, and discover the fun that digital ownership brings to the future of gaming. The items and experience earned in this JRPG will be stored on-chain to the users wallet and available in our arcade PvPvE. We have acquired the URL Blockchainia.gg as the landing page for both of these games. 

Other similar projects in the ecosystem are Ajuna network, and Asylum, among others. We differ in that we have the behavioral and marketing background to rapidly onboard users, as well as a product that can create a niche for itself in currently over-saturated market. Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to create a metaverse with endless resources because he fails to realize the human utility of the technology of his time. We have the right team and the right vision to bring the metaverse to fruition, through a fair and economical value proposition that helped NBA Jam (Midway Games) earn 1 billion dollars to Jurassic Park's (Amblin Entertainment) 395 million in 1993, in quarters (.25USD). We believe we can minimize the cost to consumers by operating our parachain at the lowest cost possible while allowing a DAO driven public server community to earn a reasonable fee for hosting the online multiplayer infrastructure of the games in our ecosystem. This fee will eventually approach a real market value which will add value to the various fungible tokens used throughout the ecosystem. 

We will create free-to-use Unity assets that compliment our tech stack to allow independent developers to duplicate our model and optionally distribute their games via our distribution architecture or use our reputation based, community moderated online-multiplayer infrastructure.

![Blockchainia Architecture](https://github.com/eca20/Blockchainia-Pitch/blob/main/blockchainiadiagram.pdf "Blockchainia Architecture")

#### Technologies Used

- Rust
- Substrate
- ink! Smart Contracts
- Node.js Front End
- C#
- Unity
- Adobe Creative Suite 
- Blender

### Ecosystem Fit

Our target audience includes game developers and gamers. Our initial target will focus on indie gamers who would like to remove the overhead realized by releasing their games through traditional distribution channels. Using our infrastructure, developers can release their game free-to-try. Developers will release an NFT collection of playable characters at the same time which grants players full access to decentralized features that will change the way gamers think about the accomplishments and items they earn in game. 

To do this, we will create or modify many existing parts of the polkadot ecosystem, including browser wallets, chain browsers, and our own parachain optimized for handling real-time game events as on-chain transactions. Our project will have a touchpoint on almost all levels of the Polkadot stack. 

In future updates, we plan to develop a decentralized means of distribution that allows game developers to release directly to consumers. Our DAO-driven community will engage with developers and provide valuable feedback on desired features, games, and the direction of Blockchainia as a whole.

## Development Status
We are in the early stages of refining a Unity first-person-shooter PvPvE game primarily in C# to create an online multiplayer game client that interacts with our server. We are implementing our own server authoritative engine to run online multiplayer games in C#, which we pan to convert to Rust. 

These repos include our R & D work. Blockchainia JRPG was our initial playground, as well as our substate

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. This project also includes creating  documentation to will allow our community to test and involve themselves in our multiplayer gaming infrastructure. We hope to receive and respond to feedback on this community documentation in Milestone 2.|
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. Unit tests will be written for relevant game server functionality. Unit tests will be written for the DeathToll pallet. In each guide (in each project's Github repo), we will describe how to run these tests. Manual integration testing will be through in-game functionality (i.e, Given an enemy is eliminated on server, the proper state functions are executed on chain, and the leader board updates through the in-game chain browser) |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide Dockerfiles that can be used to run and test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. This will include a deployable "Full Node" that encases both a game server and substrate node. These will interact with our game client and substrate parachain respectively. A successful MVP will allow a game client to register events on the game server (Server-Authoritative model), which is then written to the parachain ledger. Upon completion of the initial game "level", an "accolade" NFT will be deposited via ink! smart contract to the wallet that completed the required in-game tasks. |
| 1. | Substrate module: DeathToll Game Events | The DeathToll Game Events Substrate module will add functionality for starting/ending a "match"", start and end a "round", eliminate a player, score a point, complete a "task". Tasks examples include "move through a defined space", eliminate an AI enemy, retrieve an item, etc. This deliverable will include unit tests and instructions in the git repository. It is highly likely that we will break this into two pallets, one for core gaming functionality, and one specific to the needs of the DeathToll game-type. 
| 2. | Unity Game/Server | Both DeathToll Modules of our custom chain will interact with with open-source scripts we create to control our Unity created game server.  Each of these processes will initially be deployable via docker container. The game server architecture will operate from a community driven DAO implemented with existing pallets available in the Substrate store. 
| 3. | Unity Assets | Besides the NFT playable characters released in our games collections, all assets created by our team will be released free to use by other developers who would like to use our ecosystem to create their own games and mods. These will include wall and floor textures, doors, environment enemies, and other sprites used throughout our games. 

## Future Plans
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Oculus VR Port | We plan to port our PvPvE and JRPG to Oculus VR. This will be used to expand into a metaverse of gamers, lead by a community of streamers and industry leaders who moderate their servers and influence the direction of our development team through their position in our community DAO. 
| 2. | Front End Expansion| Our initial browser will be embedded into the game client itself. We plan to expand this to an iOS and Android apps for viewing leader boards, displaying accomplishments, and trading collectibles. 
| 3. | Community Expansion| Users who are invited to the DAO will be encouraged to run their own reputable server/node to grow their community and earn money from the pay-to-play architecture. Owners will create a hierarchy of moderators called "admins" that will ensure fair, fun, and competative gameplay throughout our ecosystem. Owners/Servers who do not fulfill their commitments to the greater community will have their influence slashed.
| 4. | Automate integration testing | Automated integration tests for all game server/blockchain interactions.
| 5. | Substrate module: DeathToll Game Events Expansion| We will add new features to the DeathToll Game Events Substrate module in seasonal updates. The features added will be driven in part by the community that plays the game, in the form of the DAO created during Milestone
